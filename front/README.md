## Structure

---
### ```components/ ```
I placed common components here. Inside it there is a ```/mixin``` folder, where I put some common styles there.

___
### ```pages/```
I put pages there. Pages could be placed in components too, but I think it's better this way.<br>
Each page includes a ```*.controllr.js``` which do the sideEffects.<br>
```*.page.js``` is just a pure component.
